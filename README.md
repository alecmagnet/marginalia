# MARGINALIA

Marginalia is a social reading and annotation app, where users can have conversations with one another about literary works they upload, comment on, and read.  

The word *marginalia* refers to the notes and markings that readers make in the margins of page. Back when books were too expensive not to share ‚Äì or even when more people borrowed physical books from the library ‚Äì these notes provides a way for readers to communicate with one another, sometimes from across centuries.  

This app seeks to restore the social dimension of reading by providing a venue for readers to speak with one another through the comments and replies they leave on literary texts.
