# MARGINALIA

Marginalia is a social reading and annotation app, where users can have conversations with one another about literary works they upload, comment on, and read.  

The word *marginalia* refers to the notes and markings that readers make in the margins of page. Back when books were too expensive not to share – or even when more people borrowed physical books from the library – these notes provides a way for readers to communicate with one another, sometimes from across centuries.  

This app seeks to restore the social dimension of reading by providing a venue for readers to speak with one another through the comments and replies they leave on literary texts.
