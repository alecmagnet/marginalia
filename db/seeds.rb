LitText.create(title: 'My Moustache', pubdate: 1924, first_name: '', last_name: 'Lu Xun', fam_name_first: false, translator:"Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang", prose: true, content:"<p>This summer I visited Changan, then drifted home again after more than a month. Friends who knew this asked me.</p><p>“What did you think of it?”</p><p>Taken aback, I tried to recall Changan, and remembered seeing a good many poplars and huge pomegranate trees there, and drinking a good deal of Yellow River water on the way. But these hardly seemed worth mentioning. So I answered.</p><p>“Oh, nothing much.”</p><p>Then they left me, looking blank, while I stayed there looking blank, ashamed to have disappointed friends who “deigned to question me.”</p><p>Today I was reading after drinking tea when a drop stained my book, and I realized that my moustache needed cutting again. If you look up the <em>Kang Xi Dictionary</em>, no doubt the different categories of beard, whiskers and moustache on the upper and lower lips, the cheeks and the jaws all have their special names and posthumous titles; but I had no time to go into this. The thing was that my moustache needed cutting again, and I should have to clip it once more, to stop it getting into my soup or tea. So I found the mirror and scissors, and started clipping, my aim being to make it level with my upper lip.</p><p>But as I clipped my moustache, I suddenly remembered Changan and my youth, and sad memories came crowding thick and fast. I can’t recall the city very distinctly, but I think it was while visiting the Temple of Confucius that I came to a room hung with a number of prints. a picture of Li Erqu and portraits of emperors of different dynasties. One of these was the first emperor of Song or some such ruler — I can’t remember clearly — anyway he was wearing a long robe, and his moustache pointed upwards. Then a well-known scholar declared emphatically, “This was faked by the Japanese. Look at that moustache — Japanese style!”</p><p>It is a fact that Japanese moustaches point upwards like that, and quite likely they faked this portrait of the first emperor of Song or whoever he was. But the subtlety and imagination required to fake portraits of all the Chinese emperors, copying their own Japanese moustaches before a mirror, surely “passes understanding.” During the reign of Emperor Qian Long of the Qing Dynasty, Huang Yi unearthed some stone carvings from the Han Dynasty Wuliang Temple, and the moustaches of most of the men on these stick up. So do most of the moustaches on the sculptures of Buddhists from the Northern Wei to the Tang Dynasty which we can see today. It is only when we come to the portraits of the Yuan and Ming dynasties that moustaches begin to droop, affected no doubt by the law of gravity. The Japanese are certainly an indefatigable race to have made so many fakes for the Han to the Tang Dynasty and buried them in deep mountains and distant valleys, amid ruins and wildernesses, through all the length and breadth of China.</p><p>I believe the drooping moustache is a Mongolian style, brought in by the Mongols, but our brilliant scholars regard it as distinctively Chinese. Since students who study in Japan are anti-Japanese, they dream of the greatness of the Mongols and like to say, “But for Heaven’s protection, we’d have wiped out that island kingdom long ago.” In this sense, I suppose there is no objection to their considering the drooping moustache as essentially Chinese. But in that case how can they be descendants of the Yellow Emperor? And how can they call the Taiwanese slaves for beating the Chinese in Fujian?</p><p>I wanted to argue at the time, but thought better of it. Didn’t that German-returned patriot, Mr. X — I’ve forgotten his name so I shall use X instead — explain that I slander China because I have a Japanese wife, and am therefore advertising our faults to them? All I did was to mention a few Chinese failings, yet that involved a change in my wife’s nationality; so what will happen this time in a question concerning Japan? Still, even if the moustache of the first emperor of Song or whoever he was is falsely accused, that can hardly cause a flood or an earthquake, so it doesn’t matter. Thereupon I nodded several times and said, “Yes, yes. Quite.” For I really seem much smoother now — much better.</p><p>After clipping the left tip of my moustache I thought: When the people of Shaanxi took the trouble to provide food and money and transport me by train, boat, mule-cart and cars to Changan to lecture there, it probably never entered their heads that I was the sort of man who would not express an opinion even on matters involving no risk of death, but would only say: “Yes, yes. Quite.” They were taken in by a fraud.</p><p>Then, as I fixed my eye on the right corner of my mouth m the mirror, clipped off the right tip of my moustache and dropped it on the floor, I started thinking of my youth.</p><p>That was a long time ago, about sixteen or seventeen years now.</p><p>Just home from Japan, and sporting the upturned moustache of the first emperor of Song or whoever he was, I was sitting in a small boat chatting with the boatman.</p><p>“You really speak Chinese very well, sir,” he finally said</p><p>“I <em>am</em> Chinese. In fact I come from the same district as you. What do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>“ I see you like to have your joke, sir.”</p><p>I remember feeling ten times more helpless on that occasion than when I read Mr. X’s letter. Since I did not carry my genealogical table with me, it was quite impossible to prove that I was Chinese. And even had I had it, it would simply have contained my name without any portrait. Nor could I have proved that this was my name. And even had there been a portrait, if the Japanese can fake sculpture from the Han to the Tang Dynasty as well as portraits of the first emperor of Song or whoever he was, it must be only too easy for them to fake a printed genealogical table.</p><p>The only way to deal with people who think the truth a joke, a joke the truth, or a joke a joke, is not to say anything.</p><p>So I stopped saying anything.</p><p>If that were to happen now, though, I would probably say, “Ah, yes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Isn’t it fine today?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What is the name of that village over there?” For I really seem much smoother now — much better.</p><p>This changing of my nationality by the boatman, as I see it now, was different from Mr. X’s honourable opinion. It was owing entirely to my moustache, which has caused me constant trouble ever since.</p><p>Though a nation may perish, there will always be plenty of champions of the national characteristics And as long as there are plenty of such champions, the nation need not be considered to have perished. Such people preserve the national characteristics, of which my moustache is one. I don’t understand the logic of this, but it certainly was the case.</p><p>“Why try to look like a Japanese — so short, and with a moustache like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” This was the conclusion of a speech in a most lofty vein delivered by a patriot and champion of national characteristics.</p><p>Unfortunately I was then still young and inexperienced, so I argued with him hotly. In the first place, I had always been short. I had not compressed myself deliberately with some foreign devil’s machine to claim a false distinction. In the second place, it was true that my moustache was like those of many Japanese; but though I had made no study of the history of changing styles in the Japanese moustache, I had seen old portraits in which their moustaches stuck not up but out and down, rather like our own national characteristic. After the Meiji Reformation of 1868, their moustaches began to stick up, probably as a result of German influence. Didn’t Kaiser Wilhelm’s moustache point up to the corner of his eyes and run parallel to his nose? Later, of course, he burned one side while smoking, so he had to cut both ends short. But he didn’t catch fire till after the Meiji Reformation in Japan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>This argument took about two minutes, but still failed to appease the patriot; for a German is a foreign devil too, and in any case I was too short. And then there are so many patriots, all of whom think alike, that I had to explain myself time and again — all to no purpose, until after one, two, ten or a dozen explanations, I felt sick and tired of the whole business. In any case, the pomade with which a moustache should be groomed was hard to get in China; so I let it take its own course.</p><p>After I let it take its own course, the two tips of my moustache began to gravitate downwards, at a right angle to the ground. Then the champions of national characteristics had nothing more to say: maybe China was already saved.</p><p>But at this point the reformers began to object, as was only natural. So I parted it once, twice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. many times, until I felt sick and tired of the whole business.</p><p>Four or five years ago, or possibly seven or eight, I was sitting alone in my hostel lamenting my moustache’s unhappy fate and pondering the reasons for its being slandered when I suddenly saw the light — the root of the trouble lay with the two tips! Then I took out the mirror and scissors, and cut it straight, so that now it points neither up nor down, but is absolutely straight.</p><p>“Ah, so that’s how you wear your moustache now?” people used to ask at first.</p><p>“Yes, like this.”</p><p>Then they would say no more. I don’t know whether this was because in the absence of two tips they had nothing on which to base an argument, or because now that my moustache was like this I was no longer responsible for China’s fate. At all events, I have had no trouble since then. The one nuisance is having to clip it from time to time.</p>", uploader_id: User.ids.sample)
